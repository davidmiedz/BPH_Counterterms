# BPH_Counterterms
Code that calculates the contributions to counterterms in phi cubed theory.

The .py file in this repository contains the necessary functions to calculate the counterterm contributions up to 5 vertices. Future work is required to generalise the differentiation and graph grouping to an arbitrary number of vertices.
